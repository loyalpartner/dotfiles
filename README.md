## Features in Detail

### Configuration Management
- XDG Base Directory compliant
- Automated backup of existing configurations
- Optional installation of dotfiles
- Supports common tools and applications:
  * Shell configurations (zsh)
  * Terminal emulators (alacritty, foot)
  * Development tools (ctags, gdb)
  * Window managers (sway)
  * Application launchers (rofi)

### Basic Environment
- Core utilities and shell tools
- Git with global configuration
- tmux with custom configuration
- System-specific optimizations

### Programming Environment
Installs and configures:
- Python (with pip and common packages)
- Node.js (with npm, yarn, and global packages)
- Go (with common development tools)
- Rust (with cargo and components)
- C/C++ development tools

### GUI Environment
Installation varies by platform:

#### macOS
- Alacritty
- iTerm2
- Visual Studio Code
- Rectangle
- JetBrains Mono Nerd Font

#### Linux
- Alacritty
- fcitx5 input method
- Various GUI utilities

## Customization

### Local Configurations
- Shell: Create `~/.zshrc.local` for machine-specific settings
- Vim: Add custom configurations in `~/.vim/custom/`
- Git: Configure user information in `~/.gitconfig.local`

### Adding New Tools
The setup script is modular and easy to extend. Add new tools by:
1. Creating a new setup function in `setup.sh`
2. Adding the tool to the appropriate installation list
3. Adding verification steps in the `verify_installation` function

## Maintenance

### Logs
- Log files are stored in `~/.local/state/dotfiles/logs/`
- Logs are automatically rotated (keeps last 5)
- Old logs (>7 days) are compressed

### Updates
- The script checks for package updates
- Updates package managers when needed
- Can be run multiple times safely

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Homebrew Installation Fails**
   ```bash
   # Check system requirements
   xcode-select --install
   ```

2. **Font Issues**
   ```bash
   # Install fonts manually
   brew tap homebrew/cask-fonts
   brew install --cask font-jetbrains-mono-nerd-font
   ```

3. **Permission Issues**
   ```bash
   # Fix directory permissions
   sudo chown -R $(whoami) ~/.config
   ```

### Debug Mode
Run with verbose output:
```bash
./setup.sh -v basic
```

Check logs:
```bash
cat ~/.local/state/dotfiles/logs/setup_*.log
```
